Still TODO
----------
Most importantly, figure out an interesting direction of research.

.Implementation
* More blockmodes (CBC, CTR if possible)
* Verify correctness for random payload and key!
* Decryption for all ciphers
* CUDA 4.0
* Try multiblock kernels again
* Streams and multi-GPU using CUDA 4
* Have a look at parallel execution again

.Organization
* Setup a project page (github or google code or asciidoc)
* Contact kgpu author
* Look for conferences

Interesting Projects
--------------------

* kgpu (GPU framework for Linux kernel)
** http://code.google.com/p/kgpu/

* SSLShader (reverse SSL proxy with GPU support)
** http://shader.kaist.edu/sslshader/

* NVIDIA Graduate Fellowships
** http://research.nvidia.com/content/nvidia-graduate-fellowship-results-2011
** Projects like SSLShader, kgpu
